This is not data that Perse has created nor estimated - we rely on the industry data as being accurate. Our Service also assumes that your energy usage will continue to the same levels as it has in the last 12 months. If you believe your usage will change, this will likely affect the accuracy of our Services. If you are unable to edit your usage via the Site yourself, please contact us at contact@perse.energy or via a partner if you think this applies to you.
